                <h2 class="section-heading">Brief</h2>
                <p>
                  I built MANAWAVE to realize a vision I had for the web. I
                  built it with what I would love as a developer exploring a new
                  library. I know the current developer landscape has so many
                  layers of abstraction and complexities. I wanted to work with
                  fundamental web foundations and idioms while enabling a wide
                  breath of expression. This would mean developers would need to
                  adjust or learn too many new concepts. They would use their
                  existing knowledge and quickly create results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I distilled 6 major principles to achieve this. It needs to
                  be:
                </p>
                <ol class="principles-list">
                  <li>web-native</li>
                  <li>performant</li>
                  <li>accessible</li>
                  <li>familiar</li>
                  <li>customizable</li>
                  <li>isolated</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Web-native and familiarity mean that MANAWAVE behaves similar
                  to a native HTML element like <code>marquee</code>. It comes
                  with the same expectations. You can style everything in it
                  with regular HTML & CSS without any workaround. It works
                  out-of-the-box with zero configuration. It's isolated from
                  other web elements, and doesn't affect anything beyond itself.
                  It can integrate with most web technologies with little
                  friction, namely accessibility and event handling. And if you
                  want to customize, MANAWAVE offers different escape hatches
                  beyond the defaults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's another layer of complexity: the library must be
                  developer-friendly. It must be documented clearly with
                  step-by-step guides and examples. The code and file layout
                  must be organized so that developers can easily parse through
                  the codebase. Lastly, the code must be unit tested to provide
                  a layer of guarantee and sanity.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Approach</h2>
                <p>
                  Developing this project took multiple stages of iterations and
                  rewrites as explore the tradeoffs of software engineering
                  decisions. It was my first time ever building something at
                  this scale with multiple modules and concerns at different
                  layers of abstraction and complexity.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Iterations and Rewrites</h2>
                <p>
                  I followed through multiple attempts to figure out and discern
                  problems as they arose. I was working blind and discovering
                  how to fulfill these requirements along the way. Inexperience
                  was my biggest time sink. A great deal of time was spent on
                  basically research and prototyping. I would implement a key
                  feature not realizing the next one wouldn't work well with my
                  given architecture. I would go on to repeat this until I
                  started to develop an intuition for dealing with interweaving
                  concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The biggest tech debt and architectural cost came from low
                  cohesion and highly coupled code. Responsibilities and
                  concerns for modules were often spread all over the place and
                  I spent a lot of time refactoring. The worst part of my old
                  code was overusing inheritance. Also, refactoring was a major
                  time sink. I refactored before knowing what I was refactoring
                  for. I applied design patterns to solve problems that didn't
                  exist. The result was insane confusion. I wanted to spend time
                  learning about design patterns and architectures which
                  ironically made me too obsessed with them. I spent more time
                  refactoring and fitting in unnecessary design patterns rather
                  than solving actual problems relating to the codebase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I decided several times to rewrite everything. It was a great
                  lesson in software engineering practices. I got more
                  productive each time applying principles like separation of
                  concerns and composition over inheritance. I isolated my code
                  to single-responsibility modules and created abstractions that
                  composed each other. It wasn't perfect, but I was able to
                  focus on solving problems in my codebase and more importantly,
                  writing code that didn't break each other.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Solving Animation</h2>
                <p>
                  Some choices I made were based on guesses and assumptions for
                  the underlying technology. For example, I could create a
                  marquee easily with CSS that could animate in the 8 basic
                  directions. I couldn't animate in any other direction though
                  (like 24.578 degrees).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is because I was relying on the WebAnimations API and CSS
                  to handle looping animations. It turned out that this API
                  relied on using keyframes and CSS animations under the hood.
                  This made <em>continual and infinite</em> animations very
                  difficult. The truth is, I viewed the problem incorrectly. CSS
                  animations and keyframes solve a subset of animation problems
                  that begin and end. Another name for
                  <em>continual and infinite</em> animations are actually
                  physics simulations. They run under a render loop that updates
                  its animation state over time in the simulation. No matter
                  what I did, the WebAnimations API wouldn't be able to support
                  this use case. I chose the WebAnimations API because the
                  animation and render logic would happen
                  <em>off the main thread</em> and leverage hardware
                  acceleration using the GPU.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I supported animating in any situation possible by creating
                  abstractions for a "physics" <code>Simulation</code>. I
                  developed <code>step</code> function that would advance the
                  <code>Simulation</code> state. The main drawback is now I have
                  to handle the complexities of the browser render pipeline and
                  main thread.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Solving Performance</h2>
                <p>
                  Browsers are limited by their reliance on a single main thread
                  to calculate and render the state of the DOM. Repeated updates
                  to the DOM is a major performance risk caused by layout
                  thrashing. Marquees have the potential to update 100s of DOM
                  elements on any given page. I realized optimizing the DOM and
                  minimizing layout thrashing would be key for MANAWAVE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To wield absolute control for animations on the web, including
                  animation or physics loops, I use
                  <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. It holds a serious risk of
                  overloading the browser (being called 60 times per second).
                  This made MANAWAVE a ticking time bomb. There were several
                  cases that would consistently crash the browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I spent many iterations and rewrites attempting to discern
                  where performance was failing. I relied deeply on the browser
                  performance profiler. It indicated that the browser paint and
                  render operations would go on infinitely. I knew that anything
                  relating the browser's render pipeline was a bottleneck. I had
                  to minimize any opportunities where the browser's render
                  pipeline would affect performance and rendering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For MANAWAVE's latest iteration, I exploited a series of
                  performance optimizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The architecture of the library would use a game development
                  principle: separate render and system logic. I treat system
                  logic calculations similar to a physics simulation update in
                  game development. This would create a hard separation of
                  concerns prevent system logic from unnecessarily triggering
                  DOM updates. It simplified and isolated performance pain
                  points when it came to optimizing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, I applied the following after a lot of experimentation
                  and back-and-forth debugging:
                </p>
                <ul class="optimization-list">
                  <li>
                    <code>absolute</code> positioning to reduce the cost of a
                    reflow
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    CSS transforms to use GPU compute off the main thread to
                    "create" and "delete" elements
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>ResizeObserver</code> to calculate and update sizes
                    without causing a reflow off the main thread
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>DocumentFragment</code> to batch DOM manipulations
                    without layout thrashing when rendering new DOM elements
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    a single, shared <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> for all
                    marquees since multiple results in worse performance
                  </li>
                  <li>minimizing the amount DOM <code>Element</code> cloned</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Essentially, getting logic and state to render on the browser
                  means computing it separately then making optimized render
                  transactions on the browser. The points I listed solve most
                  performance bottlenecks by moving any blocking operations off
                  the main thread. When I need to interact with the main thread,
                  it's concentrated and optimized for that single transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This resulted in a major performance boost from 100s of
                  elements breaking or stuttering any website to near
                  instantaneous animation and renders (&lt;5 ms to calculate,
                  layout, paint styles).

                <h2 class="section-heading">Solving Testing</h2>
                <p>
                  On top of MANAWAVE as a library, I had to make sure that it's
                  a developer-friendly project. After all, I'm open sourcing
                  this project. I believe open source is a commitment and
                  responsibility if other developers derive from MANAWAVE.
                  Documented and readable open source is a mark of care and
                  craftsmanship. The experience has to be more than good enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I tackle unit testing front-end code for the first time. I
                  struggled determining how to even get started. Usually, unit
                  testing frameworks could test raw JavaScript code in a
                  separate runtime context. It's awkward for browsers: the
                  <code>window</code> and <code>document</code> object are
                  usually not available outside of browsers, but are needed to
                  test the behavior of the DOM. There are multiple approaches
                  that work depending on how testing is viewed on the browser.
                </p>
                <ul class="testing-approaches">
                  <li>testing on a simulated browser engine (Playwright)</li>
                  <li>
                    testing on the browser itself, but need manual configuration
                    with bundler (mocha, Jasmine)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    testing UIs are in the realm of e2e tests (Cypress,
                    Selenium, webdriver)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    testing in Node.js context with mocked browser (Jest + jsdom
                    or happy-dom)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  To me, I believed that it's pointless to test on simulated
                  environments when I could test on the browser itself. Browsers
                  are all implemented differently by engine, and testing with
                  that assumption would catch bugs early. It turns out that
                  webdriverIO has a feature for browser testing on the browser
                  mixed with e2e features. I could test across Safari, Firefox,
                  and Chrome with one command and configuration file. It was
                  compatible with my codebase and bundler and required very
                  little configuration to test. I tested my code across all
                  major browsers simultatenously. This provided me safety and
                  sanity as I was developing new features for MANAWAVE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Testing with webdriverIO wasn't a perfect approach, however. I
                  realized that trying to match browser environments and account
                  the for tests made the unit tests more integrated and flaky if
                  anything. I realized that testing things within control would
                  be better, and browser contexts are usually outside of that.
                  I'm actually hoping to migrate towards testing on a mocked
                  browser for more stability and isolation.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Solving the Demo Website</h2>
                <p>
                  Building websites is my forte. I used Astro to build up
                  components and implement the website as any other static site
                  generator. Because I had absolute freedom with the websites, I
                  decided to use this opportunity to push boundaries and
                  experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used CSS grid to enforce a modular grid across the
                  <a href="https://manawave.art">demo site</a>. I made an
                  assumption that it would model the same as a graphics design
                  modular grid. In graphics design, all graphic elements share
                  the same modular grid. In current CSS, all DOM elements follow
                  the grid of its parent node. This is is fundamentally
                  different and couldn't be applied trivially. A child node
                  couldn't be aligned to the grid of an ancestor or sibling
                  node; it isn't even aware of the external grids. I had to
                  simulate the proposed subgrid feature by imitating and
                  replicating parent grids that the children nodes would be
                  aware of. This is a very flaky workaround. The subgrid
                  proposal is the real solution to this problem.

                  While learning Blender to make a light simulation, I learned
                  more deeply about compositing blend modes. I used this
                  opportunistically with CSS to determine if I could make
                  experimental effects and optimizations. I used blend modes
                  with video to create a novel glowing text effect on the front
                  page to wow my audience. I'm proud that it uses a relatively
                  cheap webm video and overlay blend mode text. It's something I
                  would expect in more complex webgl or canvas solutions, but I
                  used pure HTML and CSS. I'm even more proud of using blend
                  modes to apply colors to a single animated image. Instead of
                  having 3 images for different colors, I used blend modes to
                  apply color to only one. This saves a significant amount of
                  bandwidth since the images are animated.

                  Solving the Documentation Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                  I used the Starlight template for Astro to focus on writing
                  documentation content. Writing documentation and step-by-step
                  guides turned out to be way harder than I ever imagined.
                  Trying to communicate my features comprehensively turned out
                  to be exhausting. It's like writing a book unknowingly; it's a
                  serious investment. I was able to get close, but I wish wrote
                  documentation alongside developing features for my code. Not
                  only does it clarify what my code actually does, it can
                  identify pain points in developer experience. I was exhausted
                  because I spent so much effort recalling my choices,
                  decisions, and intuition. In the future, I'm hoping to
                  automate reference documentation from code comments. Then, I
                  want to rely on a better process to document code while
                  developing features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I wrote my documentation inspired by Astro's documentation. It
                  focused less on developers having to dig and form connections
                  themselves. Instead, they teach and guide by example. They
                  additionally offer a backdoor for reference for more advanced
                  users. It's an approach that's accomodating for all levels of
                  experience. By using step-by-step guides and leading users
                  problem-by-problem and example-by-example, it gets users up to
                  speed for the features they need. I copy this exact pattern of
                  slowing easing users into MANAWAVE by example and guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One experiment I tried was by implementing a customized
                  playground for developers. I used Sandpack, a developer
                  playground that'll allow users to code and see their results
                  live from the browser. It was worth it because not only can I
                  explain the code in the documentation guides, it's very easy
                  to <em>show</em> users rather than spend ages
                  <em>telling</em>.

                  MANAWAVE is truly my own project and endeavor. I couldn't
                  Google "how to make MANAWAVE". I realized that discovering how
                  to make things work my own way was thrilling. It comes from my
                  heart, imagination, and problem-solving — with my own two
                  hands. MANAWAVE took way longer than I ever imagined. Even
                  though I have released it to the public, and you can use it on
                  a website now, I consider MANAWAVE incomplete. I'm not sure if
                  any open-source project is ever truly done. I want to make it
                  even better because I obssessed with what it could be.
